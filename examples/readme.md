# Some GCL sample programs

### Just examples

Which you can use to test your implementation. Most of them are supposedly valid programs, but you can make variations of them to see if your BMC tool can indeed find errors.

* `E.gcl` a simple example from the Project Document. Faulty.
* `min.gcl`: returns the minimum of two integer. Supposedly valid.
* `minind.gcl`: given non-empty array `a`, it returns an index of `a` pointing to a minimum element of `a`. Supposedly valid.
* `swap.gcl`: given a non-empty array `a`, and two indices `i` and `j`, the program swaps the content of `a[i]` and `a[j]`.
* `reverse.gcl`: it returns a copy of an array `a`, but in reverse order.
